The last time I worked on this, I messed up the CSS.
Instead of freaking out and reworking all of the CSS from scratch, I'm going to fix what I can along the way for each problem.

Make functions that create assets like a card or carousel content.

quote function
A function that creates quote content as needed.

video card function
A function that creates card assets as needed.

carousel content append function
function that appends carousel assets

loader function
function that makes it so that the loader is shown while the API is loading data.

Create an ajax function for every specific API request.

#1. Homepage - quotes
function LoadQuotes()
1. Add unique IDs to all tags that you want to make variable.
2. Function makes an ajax call that gets data from api.
3. Select unique IDs and make changes.

#2 and #3 are the same

#4 is a simple ajax call and replace by selector

#5. Dropdowns will be dynamic.
API request function
function that makes an API request when something changes in search value, topic, or sort by. This function will be called by an event listener.

#6.
This changes things.
Create an ajax function for every API request. This way ajax calls are testable and easily modified by switching out functions.

For the purpose of making this easier to write, I'm just going write everything in the script tag.

new ids
carouselSmileQuotes
carouselSmilePopVideos
carouselSmileLatestVideos

async await is not ready in vanilla javascript. Because of this, I'll need to incorporate AJAX into the function itself.
